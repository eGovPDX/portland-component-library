# Button Group
A button group collects actions that are related to each other. It helps people make choices without getting lost or confused.

## When to use the Button Group component 
- When actions are connected. For example, show Submit and Save as draft together so it’s clear they are alternatives. 
- When moving through a process. Use button groups for navigation-like Back, Next, Skip, or Cancel. 

## When to use something else 
- If actions aren’t related. Placing them together can cause confusion. 
- Don’t mix destructive and safe actions in the same group (like Delete next to Save), it increases the risk of mistakes. 
- Don’t use button groups when a simple text link makes more sense. For example, “Next” and “Previous” are fine as buttons, but a “Read more” link is clearer as text. 

## General guidance 
- Keep choices simple. Too many buttons overwhelm people and slow them down. 
- Place the primary action first and make it stand out. 
- Use clear, plain text so people know exactly what each button does. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Grouped buttons help people make choices quickly by presenting related actions together. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Avoid mixing unrelated or conflicting actions in one group. This reduces mistakes and frustration. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t group buttons just to save space. Ensure the grouping makes sense from the user’s perspective. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Observe whether people choose the right button the first time. If they hesitate, rethink the grouping or labels.
