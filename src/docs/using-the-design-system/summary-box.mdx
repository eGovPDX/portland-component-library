# Summary Box
A summary box highlights the most important points from a long page or shows quick next steps. It helps people scan and act without reading everything.

## When to use the Summary Box component 
- To summarize dense content: pull out 3–5 key details people shouldn’t miss. 
- To highlight a short checklist or steps: keep it to five bullet points or fewer. 

## When to use something else 
- For navigation: don’t use a summary box as a table of contents, use jump links or side navigation. 
- On short pages: a recap isn’t needed if all content fits easily. 
- For longer or detailed lists: if there are more than five points, or if points are long or require images/buttons, use another component like a process list or graphic list. 
- For alerts or new info: if you’re highlighting something new or time-sensitive, use an alert instead. 

## General guidance 
- Prioritize what matters most. Select the key details, split them into logical parts, and order them so they make sense at a glance. 
- Link to more details if needed. Make sure links are clear about where they go. 
- Use smooth scrolling if linking within the same page, but ensure users don’t lose their place. 
- Provide a quick way back up, such as a “Back to top” link or sticky navigation. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Summary boxes help people scan and act on key details without reading a full page. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Use them to surface only the most essential information, not to repeat everything. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t add summary boxes just to fill space, they should genuinely reduce effort. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Check if users rely on the box to get the gist. If they ignore it, rethink the content.
