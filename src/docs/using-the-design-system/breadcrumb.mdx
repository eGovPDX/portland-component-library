# Breadcrumb
Breadcrumbs help people know where they are on a website and how to get back to broader sections. They support orientation and reduce confusion.

## When to use the Breadcrumb component 
- When people may land deep in your site from search or an outside link. Breadcrumbs help them see the bigger picture. 
- On complex sites with many layers of information. Breadcrumbs make it easier to move around and reinforce your site’s structure. 

## When to use something else 
- On simple sites where the main navigation already makes the page’s location clear. 
- On homepages or section landing pages where breadcrumbs don’t add value. 
- When side navigation already shows structure, breadcrumbs may be redundant. 
- In step-by-step processes, use clear step indicators instead of breadcrumbs 

## General guidance 
- Keep text readable. Don’t wrap or cut off titles in ways that confuse people, shorten page titles if needed. 
- Use the full-page title in the breadcrumb to keep labels clear and consistent. 
- Start with the word “Home,” not an icon, so people know exactly where it leads. 
- Make sure breadcrumbs are easy to tap on small screens; don’t shrink the text too much. 
- Keep breadcrumbs consistent across your site. If you use them, show them on all relevant pages. 
- Optimize for search engines by marking up breadcrumbs properly so they also improve search results. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Breadcrumbs help users understand where they are in a site and how to get back without starting over. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Place breadcrumbs where navigation is complex, so users don’t get lost. Avoid using them just for design consistency. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t repeat navigation for the sake of it. Use breadcrumbs only when they provide extra clarity. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Watch if users rely on breadcrumbs to move around. If they ignore them, consider whether the site structure itself needs work.
