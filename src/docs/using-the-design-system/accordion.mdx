# Accordion
An accordion is a list of headers that expand or collapse to show more content. It helps people find what they need without feeling overwhelmed.

## When to use the Accordion component 
- Use it when people only need a few key pieces of information on a page. 
- Use it when space is limited but the page still needs to hold a lot of content. 

## When to use something else 
- If most people need to see all the information, don’t hide it—use clear text on the page instead. 
- If there isn’t enough content to justify hiding it, avoid the accordion. It can add extra clicks and decisions for users. 

## General guidance 
- Make the entire header clickable, so it’s easy for anyone to open or close. 
- Give enough space around interactive elements so people don’t accidentally collapse or expand content. 

## Principles 
- Focus on People: avoids making users work harder than needed. 
- Solve Root Causes: encourages clarity when people need to see all information. 
- Avoid Local Optimization: reminds that just because it saves space for staff, it might burden residents. 
- Prototype and Test: easy to try with users to see if they prefer hidden or visible content.
