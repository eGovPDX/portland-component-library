# Language Selector
The language selector helps people find and use content in the language they are most comfortable with. Consistent placement and design make it easy to locate and use.

## Two Languages 

### When to use the Language Selector component 
- When your site offers the same content in two languages, so people can easily switch to their preferred one. 

### When to use something else 
- If most content isn’t translated, a selector may mislead people. Use it only when full, equivalent translations are available. 

## Three Or More Languages 

### When to use the Language Selector component 
- When your site provides the same content in three or more languages. 

### When to use something else 
- If translations are incomplete or inconsistent, don’t use the selector until the majority of content is available in all listed languages. 

### Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Language selectors ensure equal access for people who prefer or need another language. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t offer language options if most content isn’t translated. Partial translation creates frustration and broken trust. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t just add a dropdown, make sure translated content is equivalent and accurate. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Test if users can find the selector quickly and if the translations meet their needs.
