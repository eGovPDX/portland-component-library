# Radio Buttons
Radio buttons let people pick exactly one option from a list. They’re best when choices are clear and mutually exclusive (only one can be true at a time).

## When to use the Radio Buttons component 
- When only one choice is allowed from a set of options. 
- When it’s important that the choice is visible right on the page, rather than hidden in a dropdown. 

## When to use something else 
- If people may select more than one option, use checkboxes instead. 
- If space is limited and you have many options, use a select dropdown. 
- If people should be able to select none, or change their mind, use checkboxes instead. Another option is to include a “none of the above” radio button. 

## General guidance 
- Make the label clickable so users can select by clicking the text or the button. 
- List options vertically. Horizontal layouts make it harder to match labels with buttons. 
- Ensure enough space for easy selection, especially on touch screens. 
- Avoid setting a default unless there’s data to support it, it can bias users. 
- Pick one style (default or tile) and use it consistently. Don’t mix styles. 
- Organize options logically (alphabetical or most-to-least common) so users can quickly find the right choice. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Radio buttons make it clear when only one choice is possible. This avoids mistakes and second-guessing. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Always label options clearly. People should know what they’re choosing and what happens next. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t use radio buttons when multiple answers are valid, it forces users into wrong choices. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Confirm that users select confidently without asking “Can I pick more than one?”
