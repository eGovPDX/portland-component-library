# Step Indicator
A step indicator shows people their progress through a multi-step process. It helps reduce uncertainty and makes long processes easier to follow.

## When to use the Step Indicator component 
- For processes that span multiple screens or pages (three or more). It helps people see where they are and what’s left. 
- For linear sequences, where steps must be completed in order. 

## When to use something else 
- For forms with conditional logic, where steps may change based on answers. 
- For processes that can be done in any order (nonlinear). 
- For very short forms with fewer than three steps, a step indicator isn’t needed. 

## General guidance 
- Always show the current step clearly, using distinct color and text. Completed steps should look different from pending steps. 
- Use short labels, one or two words if possible. 
- Provide separate navigation (like “Back” and “Next” buttons). The indicator itself is not navigation. 
- Place a heading below each step indicator to explain the step in plain language. 
- Show both the step number and total steps (e.g., “Step 2 of 5”) to reinforce progress. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Step indicators reduce uncertainty by showing progress through a long process. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t use them for short or nonlinear flows, they’ll only confuse people. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t add steps just because they exist internally. Show only the steps that matter to the user. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Ask users if they feel reassured by the indicator. If not, revise the labels or format.
