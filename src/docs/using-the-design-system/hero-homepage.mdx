# Hero Homepage
The Hero Homepage component is a specific component with one use case: it serves as the hero section for Portland.gov. Positioned just below the navigation header, it highlights search and provides quick links to frequently used items. 

<Canvas of={HeroHomepageStories.Default} />

## When to use the Hero Homepage component 
- Use this component only on the homepage of Portland.gov. 

## When to use something else 
- Don’t use this component if you’re designing something other than the Portland.gov homepage.

## General guidance 
- This is a component with a single purpose. Any changes or variants should be handled collaboratively across teams, with Digital Services leading the work. 
- If you have insights or recommendations for improvement, share them with the Digital Services team.

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Make the homepage hero easy to scan and act on, helping community members quickly find what they need. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Use this component to reduce confusion on the homepage by surfacing the most common entry points. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t repurpose or modify the homepage hero for other pages, it’s designed to serve a single, site-wide function. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Test changes with real users to ensure updates improve clarity and support the community’s top tasks.
