# Tooltip
A tooltip is a short message that appears when someone hovers over or focuses on an element. Tooltips give quick hints without cluttering the page.

## When to use the Tooltip component 
- To provide helpful, non-critical information that supports what’s already visible. 
- To increase confidence by clarifying an action (e.g., what a button will do). 
- For short explanations or definitions. 
- As a last resort when space is tight and text can’t fit on the page. 

## When to use something else 
- For critical information needed to complete a task, don’t hide it behind a tooltip. 
- For long explanations, tooltips should be brief. 
- For repeated or obvious content, don’t use tooltips just to restate what’s clear. 
- When there’s enough space to show content directly on the page. 

## General guidance 
- Make tooltips easy to discover by attaching them to interactive elements like buttons or links. 
- Keep them brief and scannable. 
- Use them consistently across your site. 
- Position tooltips carefully so they don’t block important page content. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Tooltips provide quick clarity without cluttering the page. They should reduce, not add, confusion. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Never hide critical instructions in tooltips. Keep them for extra guidance only. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t overuse tooltips as a substitute for clear design. If everything needs a tooltip, the base design isn’t clear enough. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Watch if users notice and use tooltips. If they don’t, rethink placement or content.
