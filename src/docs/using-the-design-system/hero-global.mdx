# Hero Global
The Hero Global component is meant to introduce the page. It contains the page title, optional image, tags, description, and a call-to-action button. It helps set the context and gives people a clear sense of what the page is about.

## When to use the Hero Global component 
- Use this when you need to set the context for a page. 
- Use this when you need to introduce people to a new idea, concept, or resource. 

## When to use something else 
- If you need to provide a large amount of additional content or explanation. The Hero Global is designed to be brief and to clearly signal the purpose of the page without overwhelming users.

## General guidance 
- Always use a plain-language title and description. These help people quickly understand what the page is about. 
- Keep the page title short and specific, ideally just a few words in plain language. 
- Include an image only if it supports the purpose of the page. Images should reinforce context, not distract. 
- Use only one call-to-action button and make it clear and specific.

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Provide a simple, welcoming introduction that helps users understand what they will find on the page. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Eliminate confusion at the start by presenting the clearest possible signal about the page’s purpose. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Ensure the Hero Global is applied consistently across pages so users always know where to look for orientation. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Try different combinations of text, images, and buttons with users to confirm what works best for clarity and engagement.
