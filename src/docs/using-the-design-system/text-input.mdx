# Text Input
A text input lets people type letters, numbers, or symbols into a box. Inputs can be single-line or multi-line, depending on the response needed.

## When to use the Text Input component 
- For open-ended responses where answers vary and can’t be predicted. 
- When typing is simpler than other inputs, such as entering a birthday instead of selecting from a calendar. 
- When people need to paste in text (like copying from another document). 

## When to use something else 
- If there are set choices, use radio buttons, checkboxes, or select menus instead. 

## General guidance 
- Match the input size to the response expected. Use single-line inputs for short answers, text areas for longer ones. 
- Consider mobile users, typing is harder on phones than on desktops, so keep text input fields as simple as possible. 
- Validate only after users interact with the field, don’t show errors before they’ve typed. 
- Avoid placeholder text that disappears once typing begins. Use clear labels outside the field so users always know what’s required. This is especially important for accessibility. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Text inputs allow freedom to answer in their own words, giving flexibility where options can’t be predefined. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Always label clearly so users know what to type. Avoid placeholders that disappear. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t use text input when a checkbox or dropdown is simpler, it only adds work. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Test inputs on mobile, typing is harder on small screens, so clarity and brevity matter most.
