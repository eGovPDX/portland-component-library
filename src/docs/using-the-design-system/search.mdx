# Search
Search helps people find specific content when they can’t locate it through menus or navigation.

## When to use the Search component 
- On most sites, some people will always prefer to search rather than browse. 

## When to use something else 
- On very small or single-page sites where everything is visible without a search bar. 

## General guidance 
- Make the search box wide enough (at least 27 characters) so people can see what they typed, even with longer queries. 
- Use the magnifying glass icon, it’s universally recognized. Pair it with the word “Search” for accessibility. 
- Keep search terms visible in the results page so users can check or edit them. 
- Place a full search box on your homepage, not just a link to search. 
- Keep it simple. Most people use one or two words. Don’t make advanced search the default. 
- Always include a label (even if hidden) for screen readers. 
- Make the search button a submit button to reduce keystrokes and improve usability. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Search gives control to users who can’t find what they need in menus. It reduces frustration and saves time. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Keep search visible and results relevant. Don’t make users guess where to start. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t rely only on navigation or only on search, different people look for content in different ways. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Watch if users actually find what they need through search. If not, improve results and labeling.
