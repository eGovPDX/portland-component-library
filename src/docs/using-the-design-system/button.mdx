# Button
A button highlights the most important actions people can take. It stands out on the page so users know where to click.

## When to use the Button component 
- For the main actions you want people to take, like Download, Sign up, or Log out. 
- When you want to clearly guide people to the next step. 

## When to use something else 
- Use regular links for simple navigation between pages. 
- If the action is minor or rarely used, style it as a link instead of a button. 

## General guidance 
- Use standard buttons for actions that move people forward. 
- Use outline buttons for actions that stay on the same page (like expand or collapse). 
- Make the most important action stand out with a distinct color or size. Don’t make every button look the same. 
- Ensure buttons look clickable, use clear color changes for hover and active states. 
- Don’t overload a page with too many buttons; it creates confusion. 
- Keep button text short and clear. Start with a verb, like File a complaint or Download report. 
- Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word). 
- Icons can help signal meaning (like a download arrow), but don’t rely only on them. Always use text too. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Buttons should make the most important actions obvious and easy to take. Clear labeling reduces hesitation. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t just label a button “Submit” or “Click here.” Use language that tells users what will happen, like “Pay now” or “Get updates.” 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t overload a page with buttons for every possible action. Too many choices dilute focus. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Test button clarity with real users. If they hesitate before clicking, revise the text, style, or placement.
