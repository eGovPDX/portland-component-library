# Process List
A process list shows the main steps or stages of an important task. It helps people see the order of steps at a glance.

## When to use the Process List component 
- To display high-level, sequential steps. 
- To give people a clear roadmap through a process, making it easier to follow each stage. 

## When to use something else 
- For multi, page forms or wizards, use a step indicator instead. 
- To show current status or progress in a process, use a step indicator. 
- For in, page navigation, use side navigation. 
- For non, sequential content, use unordered lists, icons, or other list formats. 
- To break up long sentences or paragraphs, use standard ordered or unordered lists. 

## General guidance 
- Keep lists manageable. Aim for 3–10 steps so the process feels clear, not overwhelming. 
- Use consistent headings. Each step should follow the same pattern (e.g., start with a verb). 
- Add supporting content if needed, like images, links, or tables, to clarify each step. 
- Use step numbers (counters) when reinforcing sequence is important; omit them if they add clutter. 
- Keep step labels short, clear, and action-oriented. 
- Style steps consistently so people can scan easily, avoid unnecessary decoration. 
- Use color carefully. Colors should support clarity (like showing pending vs. current steps), not distract. 
- Make sure spacing is consistent, avoid wide gaps that break the flow. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Process lists give users a clear roadmap, reducing stress when completing multi-step tasks. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Break processes into simple, logical steps. Avoid jargon or long sentences that hide what needs to be done. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t add steps just to mirror internal processes. Show only what users truly need. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Ask users if they can follow the list without extra explanation. If not, simplify.
