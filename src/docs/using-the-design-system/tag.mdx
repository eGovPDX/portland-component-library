# Tag
A tag highlights important or categorized content. Tags help people notice key updates, filter information, or see counts of new items.

## When to use the Tag component 
- To draw attention to important or new content that might otherwise be missed. 
- To filter results, allowing users to narrow content with one or more tags. 
- To show a count of new or unread items, like the number of messages or alerts. 

## When to use something else 
- If tags might be confused with buttons, avoid placing them in the same area. 
- To call attention to new or updated content, sometimes a simple background or text change is more effective. 
- On sites where content is always changing (like breaking news), it may be enough to just show the newest content at the top. 

## General guidance 
- Test carefully, people often mistake tags for buttons. 
- If a tag isn’t clickable, make sure it doesn’t look interactive (no hover or focus effects). 
- Be consistent, don’t mix interactive and non, interactive tags on the same page. 
- Use tags sparingly, if everything is tagged, nothing stands out. 

## Principle 
- **Focus on People:** Tags help people notice what’s new or filter to what matters most. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t tag everything, too many tags create clutter and reduce usefulness. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t use tags inconsistently across pages. Users expect tags to behave the same everywhere. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Confirm whether users recognize tags as filters, labels, or alerts. If not, refine their design or placement.
