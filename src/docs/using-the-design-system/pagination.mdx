# Pagination
Pagination splits large sets of content into smaller pages. It helps people move through search results, articles, or records without being overwhelmed.

## When to use the Pagination component 
- Search results: When results are too long for a single page. Pagination helps people browse in manageable chunks. 
- Large collections: When you have a lot of related items, like articles, case files, or archived records. 

## When to use something else 
- If content is grouped meaningfully by topic or theme, use navigation like side menus instead. 
- If showing progress through steps (like onboarding or applications), use a step indicator. 
- If the collection is short (3–4 screen lengths), just display all items instead of paginating. 

## General guidance 
- Show people where they are. Indicate the total number of pages or results when possible. 
- Always include first, previous, and next navigation so users don’t get stuck. 
- Keep pagination in a single line, multiple lines are harder to scan and use. 
- Use simple, clear markers (like an ellipsis “…”) to show when pages are skipped. 
- Don’t overload with too many page links, keep it focused and usable. 
- Make page numbers big enough to tap on mobile without errors. 
- Optimize entries per page. Balance performance with user needs, and consider letting people choose how many items to display. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Pagination makes large sets of information manageable by breaking them into smaller, scannable pages. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Always show people where they are in the sequence, so they don’t feel lost in endless results. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t show dozens of page numbers. Prioritize navigation that helps users, not what looks “complete.” 
- **Prototype and Test:** Check if people can move forward and back easily. If not, adjust labels, layout, or page size.
