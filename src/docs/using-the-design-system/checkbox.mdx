# Checkbox
A checkbox lets people select one or more options from a list. It’s a simple way to show choices and to let people easily see and change what they’ve selected.

## When to use the Checkbox component 
- When people can select more than one option from a list. 
- When people need to confirm or accept something, like agreeing to terms. 
- When people need to switch between two states, like “yes/no” or “on/off.” 

## When to use something else 
- If only one option can be selected from a list, use radio buttons instead. 

## General guidance 
- Make labels clickable. People should be able to select either the text or the checkbox. 
- List options vertically to avoid confusion about which label belongs to which box. 
- Use positive, clear language. For example, say “I want to receive updates” instead of “I don’t want to stop receiving updates.” 
- Use logical labels so both states (checked and unchecked) are easy to understand. If that’s not possible, use radio buttons instead. 
- Ensure checkboxes are large enough to tap easily on touch screens. 
- Pick one style and use it consistently (don’t mix tile and standard checkboxes). 
- Organize options in a clear order, such as alphabetical or most common to least common, so people can quickly find what they need. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Checkboxes give flexibility when more than one option may apply. They help people feel in control of their choices. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Use clear, positive labels so people know exactly what selecting or unselecting means. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t use checkboxes where only one option makes sense, that creates confusion. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Confirm that users understand they can select multiple options. If not, consider a different input.
