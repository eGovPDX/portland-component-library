# Banner
A banner shows that a website is official and secure. It builds trust by letting visitors know they are on a real government site.

## When to use the Banner component 
- To identify your site as an official government website. 
- Federal sites use the standard banner. State and local sites should adjust the text to reflect their level of government. 

## When to use something else 
- If your site doesn’t use a .gov or .mil domain and HTTPS, don’t use this banner. These are the key signals people recognize as official. 
- Never use the banner on test sites or places where it would be misleading. The goal is to reduce confusion, not create it. 

## General guidance 
- Use the standard text provided. Don’t rewrite or customize it, consistency helps people quickly recognize official sites. 
- Match the banner text to your domain (e.g., use the .mil version for military sites). 
- Show the banner on every page. If it’s only on some pages, visitors may get confused or doubt the site’s legitimacy. 
- Keep the design simple. Use background colors that fit your site’s theme without drawing unnecessary attention to the banner. 
- Keep the text current. Always use the latest version. 
- Provide Spanish-language versions where needed so all residents understand the message. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Banners give people confidence that they are on an official, secure website. This reassurance builds trust. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Avoid jargon. The banner should state plainly what makes the site official and why it matters for safety or trust. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t add a banner just because it’s standard. Use it only when it genuinely helps people identify the site. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Test whether users notice and understand the banner’s purpose. If it doesn’t build trust, revise the wording.
