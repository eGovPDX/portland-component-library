# Designing for humans

This design system aims to make building easier so you can focus on people. With accessibility, mobile support, and design standards already built in, you can start with the needs of residents and staff. Here are some key principles to guide your work.

### Focus on People

Design for residents, businesses, and staff, their needs and real-life experiences. Don’t design only for internal rules or workflows. Start from what people experience when applying for services, paying bills, reporting problems, or finding information.

Example: Instead of a dense housing assistance application, use plain questions that guide people step by step, reducing confusion and support calls.

### Solve Root Causes

Don’t just treat symptoms, find the real barrier. Before launching a new tool, ask: What problem are we solving for residents? For staff? If people call 311 about “website errors,” the issue may be unclear instructions, not the server.

Example: Instead of creating a new call center script because “calls are too long,” the deeper issue may be confusing trash pickup rules that need simpler communication.

### Avoid Local Optimization

Think big picture, not just one department or step. Fixes must work across departments to feel seamless. An optimized bill-pay system won’t help if utility rules are still buried in PDFs and require office visits.

Example: Streamlining one benefits form helps, but real impact comes from connecting housing, health, and social services into a single intake process.

### Prototype and Test

Don’t aim for perfect. Start small, test with real people, improve quickly. Treat services as living systems that evolve.

Example: If a chatbot for library card signups gives confusing answers, adjust the language after observing real users. Don’t wait months for a big release.

### In Summary

- People first → resident and staff needs come first.
- Right problem → fix the root cause, not just the symptom.
- System view → solutions must work across departments, not in silos.
- Iteration → test early, learn fast, keep improving.
