# Dropdown
A Dropdown menu lets people choose one option from a list that drops down.

## When to use the Dropdown component 
- Only when space is limited and there are about 7 to 15 options. 
- Best used when showing all options at once would clutter the page. 

## When to use something else 
- If there are fewer than 7 options → use radio buttons. 
- If there are more than 15 options → consider a combo box or other pattern. 
- If people need to dropdown more than one option → use checkboxes. 
- For site navigation → use navigation menus, not dropdowns. 

## General guidance 
- Test with users: Dropdown menus can be confusing. Make sure your audience can use them easily. 
- Avoid dependent menus: Don’t make one dropdown change another, it’s often unclear to people how choices are linked. 
- Provide a good default: If most people will choose the same option, pre-dropdown it to save time (but only if supported by data). 
- Don’t auto-submit: Avoid forms that submit as soon as an option is chosen. Instead, use a clear Submit button so people can confirm their choice. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Dropdown menus save space but should remain simple and easy to use. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t overload dropdown with too many or too few options, choose inputs that match the decision. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t use dropdown just for convenience. They can slow people down compared to buttons or checkboxes. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Confirm that users understand how to open, choose, and confirm without confusion.
