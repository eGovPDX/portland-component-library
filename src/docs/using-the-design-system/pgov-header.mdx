# PGOV Header
The PGOV Header component is a specific component with one use case: it serves as the header and navigation for Portland.gov. 

<Canvas of={PGOVHeaderStories.Default} />

## When to use the PGOV Header component 
- Use this component when you’re building a page on Portland.gov. 

## When to use something else 
- Don’t use this component if you’re not building a page on Portland.gov. 

## General guidance 
- This is a global component with a single purpose. Any changes or variants should come through collaboration across teams, with Digital Services leading the work. 
- If you have insights or recommendations for improvement, share them with the Digital Services team.

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Ensure the header consistently helps visitors navigate Portland.gov without confusion. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Use the global header to avoid fragmented or inconsistent navigation patterns across different parts of the site. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t modify or fork this component for local needs, keep it unified so all users experience the same structure. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Work with Digital Services to test any potential changes to the header so updates support all users.
