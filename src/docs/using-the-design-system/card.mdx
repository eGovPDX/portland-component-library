# Card
A card groups content and actions about a single subject. It gives a short summary and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Cards often include text, images, and links, and are usually shown as part of a set.

## When to use the Card component 
- To show collections of related content, like articles, services, or resources. 
- To make information easier to scan and compare at a glance. 

## When to use something else 
- For tabular data, use a table, not cards. 
- For single, important actions, use a button. 
- For standalone information, use an aside or simple page content instead. 
- For long, continuous text, use regular headings and paragraphs, not cards. 

## General guidance 
- Make cards actionable. Each card should link to more detail or a clear next step. 
- Don’t use cards just for decoration. They should organize or highlight useful content. 
- Avoid repetition. Don’t reuse the same image or text across every card in a set. 
- Use images that work well at any size, since cards often resize on different devices. 
- Keep styling simple. Avoid effects like shadows, folds, or textures that distract from the content. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Cards break down complex information into digestible chunks, helping people scan and compare options. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t fill cards with repeated or decorative content. Each card should add unique value. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Avoid over-styling cards just for visual interest. The design should make content easier, not harder, to scan. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Check if users can find the right card quickly. If they have to open multiple cards to find what they need, rethink labels and organization.
