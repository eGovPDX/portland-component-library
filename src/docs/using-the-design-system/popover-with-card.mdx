# Popover With Card
The Popover with Card component is for specific scenarios where you need to share more information than a standard tooltip can provide. Think of it as similar to Wikipedia’s page preview tooltip, offering a quick look without overwhelming users or pulling them away from the page. 

<Canvas of={PopoverWithCardStories.Default} />

## When to use the Popover With Card component 
- Use this when you need to share 1–2 short sentences that give users added context. 
- Use this when you want to pair a short description with a supporting image. 
- Use this when you need to connect a short description with a single call to action. 

## When to use something else 
- When you only need to display a few words, use a tooltip instead. 
- When you have a full paragraph or more of text, place the content on the page itself. 
- When you need to display multiple images or multiple calls to action, use a card or section layout.

## General guidance 
- This component is designed for a very specific purpose: giving quick access to short definitions or supporting details that help reduce page length and increase clarity. 
- Avoid hiding critical information inside this component. Popovers should only provide supplementary context, not essential instructions or requirements. 
- If you think you have a use case that falls outside of these purposes, check with the digital services team before implementing.

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Popovers should make content easier to understand at a glance, not harder to access. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Use them to reduce page length and surface just enough context where users need it most. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t overload popovers with too much content or too many interactions, they are not a replacement for clear on-page information. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Try popovers with real users to confirm they clarify rather than confuse.
