# Alert
An alert tells people about important or time-sensitive changes. It helps them stay informed and know what to do next.

## When to use the Alert component 
- To show system updates, like errors, warnings, or general notices. 
- To confirm or correct actions, like letting someone know a payment went through or a form needs fixing. 

## When to use something else 
- On long forms, use in-line messages next to the field, not just at the top. 
- For destructive actions (like deleting an account), use a stronger pattern such as a confirmation box. 

## General guidance 
- Guide next steps: If action is needed, clearly say what to do and make it easy. 
- Be respectful: Use plain, polite language. Never blame the person. 
- Make alerts helpful: Include useful info, not just “something went wrong.” 
- Don’t overload: Too many alerts frustrate people and get ignored. 
- Give control: Let people dismiss alerts when appropriate. 
- Stay relevant: Show alerts that match the person’s goal in that moment. 
- Keep them visible: Don’t hide alerts in ways that confuse screen readers or assistive technology. 

## Principle 
- **Focus on People:** Alerts should guide people calmly and clearly, especially during stressful situations like errors or deadlines. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Write alerts that explain what went wrong, why it matters, and what to do next. Avoid vague or technical language. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t overload people with too many alerts. Prioritize the most important information so users aren’t trained to ignore them. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Check if users understand alerts without extra help. If they hesitate or misinterpret, refine the wording and placement.
