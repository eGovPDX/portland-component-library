# Identifier 
The identifier shows which parent agency is responsible for a site. It also displays required agency links, helping visitors know they are on an official government website.

## When to use the Identifier component 
- To identify the highest-level agency that owns or oversees the site. 
- As a complement to the USWDS banner, making the site’s authority and ownership clear. 
- Even if your agency is the top-level owner, you can still use the identifier to show it officially. 

## When to use something else 
- Don’t use it if it would be misleading, such as on test or non-official sites. 
- Avoid duplicating content. If the footer already has required links, replace them with the identifier instead of repeating them. 

## General guidance 
- Use the identifier for required links and remove duplicates from your footer so visitors see links in a consistent place across sites. 
- Treat the “parent agency” as the highest-level authority for the site or service. If your site doesn’t have a parent, use your own agency name. Example: [agency.gov] An official website of [Agency]. 
- Show the parent agency logo, not a program or product logo. Program logos should stay in the footer, not in the identifier. 
- If there are multiple parent agencies, list them in order from highest to lowest level (e.g., “An official website of [Grandparent Department] and [Parent Agency]”). 
- Keep it simple. The identifier should appear on every page without distracting from the main content. Use background colors that fit your site design. 
- Keep the text current, always use the latest version. 

## Principles 
- **Focus on People:** Identifiers make it clear who is responsible for the website or service, which builds trust. 
- **Solve Root Causes:** Don’t bury official ownership in fine print. People should see immediately which agency or department runs the site. 
- **Avoid Local Optimization:** Don’t add duplicate or redundant identifiers. Overlap with the footer or banner can confuse more than clarify. 
- **Prototype and Test:** Ask users if they know who runs the site after looking at the identifier. If not, revise the text or placement.
