# Portland Component Library Progress Report

## Current Progress

### Documentation Structure
We have established a comprehensive documentation site using Storybook that:
- Provides clear usage guidelines for all components
- Includes live examples and interactive documentation
- Makes it easy for developers to understand component APIs
- Integrates with the design system through MDX files

### Core Layout Components
We have implemented the fundamental building blocks needed for Portland.gov pages:

#### Header
- Navigation component based on USWDS Header
- Supports responsive layouts
- Includes accessibility features

#### Banner
- Official government site identification
- Meets federal requirements for .gov domains
- Consistent branding across all pages

#### Footer
- Site-wide links and information
- Accessibility statement integration
- Social media and contact information
- Service request functionality

#### SkipNav
- Keyboard accessibility enhancement
- Hidden until focused
- Improves navigation for screen reader users

#### PageTemplate
- Combines all core components
- Provides consistent page structure
- Handles responsive behavior
- Manages component composition

### Design Token Implementation

#### Current Token Architecture
- Design tokens are defined in SCSS files:
  - `src/styles/themes/pgov.scss`: Main Portland.gov theme
  - `src/styles/themes/pgov-dark.scss`: Dark mode variant
- Tokens cover:
  - Typography
  - Colors
  - Spacing
  - Border radius
  - Shadows
  - Z-index

#### Theme Usage
- Components use SCSS variables for theming
- Dark mode support is implemented
- Token documentation is maintained in Storybook

### Component Cleanup
- Removed unnecessary components (e.g., Button)
- Focused library on Portland.gov specific needs
- Maintained clear component boundaries
- Eliminated redundant implementations

### Developer Experience
We've established clear processes for:
- Component development workflow
- Testing changes in Storybook
- Maintaining documentation
- Theme customization

## Progress Towards Design System Goals

### 1. Consistent Page Building
- ✅ Core layout components implemented
- ✅ Basic design tokens defined
- ✅ Theme support established
- ✅ Documentation in place

### 2. Accessibility and Responsiveness
- ✅ Built-in accessibility features
- ✅ Responsive by default
- ✅ WCAG compliance
- ✅ Screen reader support

### 3. Design-Code Synchronization
- ✅ Manual token updates
- ✅ Version controlled design tokens
- ⏳ Automated Figma synchronization (planned)
- ⏳ Token transformation pipeline (planned)

### 4. Developer Adoption
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Interactive examples
- ✅ Easy-to-use APIs
- ✅ Streamlined workflow

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Automated Token Pipeline
The planned token pipeline will connect Figma to our component library:

#### A. Setup Figma Token Studio
- Install and configure Tokens Studio plugin in Figma
- Organize existing tokens into Figma variables
- Set up token categories and groups
- Establish naming conventions

#### B. Create Token Transformation Pipeline

The token pipeline follows this sequence:

1. **Figma Design Tokens** → Design tokens are maintained in Figma
2. **Tokens Studio** → Export tokens using the Figma plugin
3. **JSON Export** → Raw token data in standard format
4. **Token Transformer** → Process and transform tokens
5. **SCSS Variables** → Convert to SCSS format
6. **Component Library** → Use in components

Each step ensures our design tokens stay synchronized from Figma through to the final implementation.

### 2. Expand Theme Support
- Implement light theme
- Implement generic dark theme
- Add theme switching utilities
- Improve theme documentation

### 3. Component Enhancements
- Add more usage examples
- Expand component test coverage
- Improve build performance
- Add component visual regression tests

### 4. Documentation Improvements
- Add token usage guidelines
- Create theme customization guide
- Add more interactive examples
- Include migration guides

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Optimize bundle size
- Improve CSS delivery
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement lazy loading strategies
